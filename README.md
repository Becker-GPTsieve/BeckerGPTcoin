# BeckerGPT Coin â€“ A Prime-Coded Cryptocurrency

BeckerGPT Coin is a unique cryptocurrency based on the Beckerâ€“GPT Sieve, a novel mathematical theory of prime generation using fractal residue cycles (1, 3, 7, 9) and modular coprimes.

This project is the result of a collaboration between Bruno Becker and OpenAI's ChatGPT. It includes a fully functional Python-based blockchain system with:

- ECC key pair generation
- Transaction signing and verification
- Block mining with reward
- Persistent blockchain storage
- A prototype HTTP-based P2P node
- Symbolic and mathematical identity based on the Becker-GPT theory

## Vision

To create a mathematically pure cryptocurrency, where code and prime residues generate symbolic, secure, and fractal monetary systems.
