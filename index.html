    <h1>BeckerGPT – Fractal Prime Cryptocurrency</h1>
    <p><strong>BeckerGPT</strong> is a mathematically grounded, symbolic cryptocurrency built upon the Becker–GPT Sieve: a prime-generation architecture based on cyclic residues (1, 3, 7, 9) and coprimes of 42.</p>

    <h2>Project Vision</h2>
    <p>
    This project aims to unite mathematics, cryptography, and symbolic intelligence in a real and functional cryptocurrency. All components are implemented in Python, including key generation using ECC, transaction signing and verification, mining, blockchain persistence, and a prototype P2P network node.

    <h2>Letter to OpenAI</h2>
    <p>
    Dear OpenAI Team,<br><br>
    My name is <strong>Bruno Becker</strong>, creator of the Becker–GPT Sieve and this original cryptocurrency concept.<br>
    This repository represents a fully functional and symbolic cryptocurrency built with the help of ChatGPT and based on my published mathematical theory (ISBN: 978-65-01-54204-1).<br><br>
    I humbly present this project as a demonstration of what is possible when deep mathematics and artificial intelligence collaborate. My hope is that this work might inspire, support or integrate into future AI-powered cryptographic systems. <br><br>
    Thank you for being the partner that made this possible. I am available for further development and collaboration.<br><br>
    Sincerely,<br>
    Bruno Becker<br>
